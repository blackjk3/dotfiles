# Paul's dotfiles.

[mathias's readme](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) is awesome. go read it.

This is a fork of [Paul Irish's dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles), which is a fork of [mathias's](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/). However, since I'm using zsh and not bash, I've removed quite a few dotfiles.

## Dependancies and Niceties

Some dependancies and features that are nice to have are captured in `install-deps.sh` which adds homebrew, z, nave, etc. Run at your leisure.

## Syntax highlighting

…is really important. even for these files.

Install [Dotfiles Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/mattbanks/dotfiles-syntax-highlighting-st2) via [Sublime Text 2 Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)


### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```


## overview of files

####  Automatic config
* `.ackrc` - for ack (better than grep)

* `.zshrc`
* `.exports`
* `.functions`

#### manual run
* `install-deps.sh` - random apps
